It also critically evaluates the approach and/or results.\nexperiment with and simulate data science solutions\nThe project describes how the presented approach or the results may practically be used in data science application.\nwrite/configure computer programs/tools specific to certain subject areas\nThe tools used in the project are well chosen.\nmaster relevant data pre/post-processing routines\nThe project shows and documents the data flow from its origin to the results which can be reproduced.\ndesign and schedule a DS project of medium complexity, including escape options, and keep milestones/timelines\nThis not an assessment criterion, but is realized through the activities and presentations during the semester.\nimprove their academic writing skills\nThe text in the project reports is well structured and well written.\ncommunicate results to a non-expert audience\nThe text has an introduction or abstract and conclusion which are understandable by a non-expert audience.\ndesign their own digital application\nThis is not an assessment criterion. The ILO is touched in 2.\n\n\n6.1 Main Learning Goal\nThis Data Science Lab shall deepen your skills for your more and more independent data science work based on a self-designed project. That means you become more experienced in\n\nin using the core concepts in data science on your own, for example\n\nexploring data (import, wrangle, visualize)\nlearning, exploring and applying mathematics and statistics through the data science lens\nlearning and applying concepts to model and draw conclusions from data (model, infer, predict)\n\ncreating and maintaining a digital working environment on your computer to do data science\nprogramming in the data science languages R and/or python, and become able to learn new skills in these independently\nimprove your skills in documenting and presenting your findings with compelling visualizations, descriptions, interpretations, and narratives",

    "text": "7 Examination and Assessment\nAssessment Type: Project Assessment (see Section 6) Weight: 100%\nScope: All intended learning outcomes of the module (see Section 6).\nCompletion: to pass this module, the examination has to be passed with at least 45%\n\n7.1 Project Delivery\nThe project components must be delivered in a project-repository on GitHub provided by the instructor in the GitHub-Organization CU-S25-MSDSSB-DSCI-01-DataScienceLab. If your project requires another way of delivery, get in contact with the instructor before the submission.\n\n\n7.2 Project Format\nLab projects can have different formats. The main contribution need not be a text. It will be developed during the course.\nFor proper assessment, the repository should have at least one human-readable document which can be read without considering code. Examples:\n\nA rendered quarto file in html-format guiding through the project. These files can be best viewed on a local machine in a browser (but not from the GitHub-Website in a private repository). However, they can be made publically viewable from the Internet via GitHub-pages with a few clicks later if you want.\n\nFiles in GitHub flavored markdown (gfm) like the typical README.md. These have slightly fewer formatting options but can be viewed directly on GitHub. This may be a good solution for code-heavy projects.\nAlternative or additional options which may be used with a particular reason: A slide deck in revealjs-html or PDF-file. A paged report as a PDF-file.\nIn any case: Do not submit your work in Word or PowerPoint format (e.g., docx, pptx) or related formats from Apple or Libre Office. All these formats can be converted to PDF – submit such a PDF.\n\nThe instructor starts assessment with reading the README.md of the project repository, then going to the main description file specified as the main human-readable document.\nThe repository should also include all the code used to do data collection and import, data analysis, visualizations, predictions, and whatever else the project is about. If useful this can be in scripts separated from the human-readable file.\n\n\n7.3 Project “Length”\nYour text should begin with a section called Abstract, Outline, or Executive Summary with between 120 and 500 words.\n\nThere is no minimal or maximal number of words! (Some project’s main part maybe code or visualizations.)\nThere is no minimal or maximal number of lines of code! (Some project’s main part may be the documentation, description, interpretation, and critical reflection.)\n\nThere is no minimal or maximal number of pages! (You can count pages only if you deliver a slidedeck, or a PDF.)\n\nSome guidelines are:\n\nA short contribution is good when it is concise and covers all aspects. A long contribution is good when it is well structured (in a hierarchy of importance) and not redundant.\nIf your human-readable text is much less than 3,000 words: Consider if some parts should be extended. Go in detail over the assessment criteria and check that your document covers all the aspects which need to be assessed, is well readable, clear, and concise for an external reader. If this is the case it is great when you can stay below 3,000 words!\nIf your human-readable text has more than 6,000 words: Consider to\n\nmake it shorter by making it more concise and less redundant\nstructure it in a core part with less than 3,000 words and appendices with additional information (your main text can refer to appendix sections)\nusing footnotes for additional information (However, avoid too extensive use of long footnotes. At some point it is better to make an appendix section.)\n\nThe assessment goes only along the criteria listed below. A long contribution may receive lower assessments when it communicates less effectively and less to the point. Beware not to deliver generic ChatGPT-like “bla-bla”!\nCheck and polish your code. Check if the code reproduces your results. Remove unnecessary code, and spend some explanatory comments on interesting non-standard steps. Large parts of unnecessary code can be considered as less effective and less clear communication. However, your code need not be excessively educational with a comment on every line.",

    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Elicit, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nI encourage you to using and exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how certain topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive a lot of false information! Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learning time with chatting. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, practicing, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot (free to use for students and teachers) are heavily used and currently change code-writing. They can speed up writing your code. However, they do not deliver always correct solutions. There is no way around understanding yourself what a code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look, they rarely deliver the complete code. Expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong. You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot!\nHave a draft text snippet written. Data science is also about formulating and describing research questions, describing data, documenting code, interpreting results, and deriving conclusion form the results. This is all verbal text and chatbots are good in writing text which often appears well readable. You can use this to inspire yourself and to polish and improve your texts. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! In text generated purely by a chatbot it is often evident that you do not.\n\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\nNote on assessment of your text be it written with or without AI: Text written by chatbots is often very generic and less specific. Often, ChatBots deliver bullshit (as defined by H. Frankfurt) . Large parts of very generic bullshit-like text will be assessed worse than a short more specific text!\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work.",
