That means you become more experienced in\n\nin using the core concepts in data science on your own, for example\n\nexploring data (import, wrangle, visualize)\nlearning, exploring and applying mathematics and statistics through the data science lens\nlearning and applying concepts to model and draw conclusions from data (model, infer, predict)\n\ncreating and maintaining a digital working environment on your computer to do data science\nprogramming in the data science languages R and/or python, and become able to learn new skills in these independently",

    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nI encourage you to using and exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how certain topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive a lot of false information! Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learning time with chatting. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot (free to use for students and teachers) are heavily used and currently change code-writing. They can speed up writing your code. However, they do not deliver always correct solutions. There is no way around understanding yourself what a code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look, they rarely deliver the complete code. Expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong. You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot!\nHave a draft text snippet written. Data science is also about formulating and describing research questions, describing data, documenting code, interpreting results, and deriving conclusion form the results. This is all verbal text and chatbots are good in writing text which often appears well readable. You can use this to inspire yourself and to polish and improve your texts. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! In text generated purely by a chatbot it is often evident that you do not. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible text. Also text written by chatbots is often very generic and less specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Large parts of very generic text is considered worse than a shorter more specific text. In extreme case, a long very generic text will be considered worse than no text at all\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\n\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work.",
